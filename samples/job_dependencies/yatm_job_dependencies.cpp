			Expected result is the children of each [groupN_job] task to be executed first. When all of the dependencies of each [groupN_job] are resolved,
			[groupN_job] will be executed. Once that happens, [groupN] is executed (being a simple group without a job function, it does nothing, simply used for grouping).
			Once both [group0] and [group1] are finished, [parent] executes and the tasks are complete.

			After [parent] is finished, sch.wait(parent) will unblock and main thread execution will continue.
			An alternative way to wait for the tasks to finish is by using the yatm::counter object. This is atomically incremented when jobs that reference it are added to
			the scheduler and decremented when jobs are finished. When the counter reached 0, it's assumed to be finished and sch.wait(&counter) will unblock the main thread.
